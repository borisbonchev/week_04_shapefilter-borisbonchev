= Exercise Shapefilter

In package `shapes.basic` you have multiple shapes, among which are:

* *Disk* which extends Circle. Disk contains an image.
* *Sphere* which extends Disk. Sphere creates a 3D like image of a sphere or Ball.

The essential detail here is that Disk and Sphere are sub classes of Circle.
There is no need to change anything in this package. Just check if you
understand the inheritance hierarchy and the use of interfaces and abstract
classes.

.Hierarchy of shapes, assume mathematical shapes, so a line has no width and hence no surface area. Nor does an arc.

*Shape filter*
This part is about generics. Remember the PECS acronym. In the ShapeManager
test-driven develop two methods:

* `void addShapes(List<...> shapesToAdd)` Make sure to use the proper
list definition with generics. The idea is that each list of
shapes (e.g. a list of Circles, a list of Disks, a list
of Shapes can be processed).

* `boolean collectShapesOfType( Collection<...> consumer, Class<...> type )` This method takes two arguments,
(1) a list (like a list) in which you can put shapes and (2) the type of shape
you want to filter. For example, youâ€™re passing an empty list that is filled
with all Circles.

The learning goal in the exercise is to get the generics write, almost a fill in the dots in the methods above.
Of course the declaration must be correct on both call-site (where you call the method) and at the method site.

Using raw types is certainly wrong.
